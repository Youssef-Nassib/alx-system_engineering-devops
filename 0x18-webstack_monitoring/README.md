Postmortem: Web Application Outage on August 15, 2024
Issue Summary
Duration:
Outage lasted for 2 hours from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM UTC on August 15, 2024.

Impact:
Our primary web application, serving approximately 80% of our user base, experienced a complete outage. Users were unable to access the site, receiving a "503 Service Unavailable" error. This affected 100% of active users during this time frame, with an estimated 10,000 users unable to access the service.

Root Cause:
The root cause was a configuration error in the Nginx load balancer, which inadvertently directed all incoming traffic to a single, overburdened server, rather than distributing it across the available server pool.

Timeline
10:00 AM UTC:
The issue was detected via a Datadog alert indicating a sudden drop in traffic and an increase in 503 errors.

10:05 AM UTC:
Engineers were notified and began investigating the application servers, assuming a potential resource exhaustion or database issue.

10:20 AM UTC:
Misleading assumption led to restarting the database server and increasing instance sizes, which did not resolve the issue.

10:35 AM UTC:
Further investigation revealed that the issue was not at the application or database level, but rather in the traffic routing handled by the Nginx load balancer.

10:45 AM UTC:
The incident was escalated to the DevOps team to review the Nginx configuration.

11:15 AM UTC:
The DevOps team identified a recent configuration change in the Nginx load balancer that caused all traffic to route to a single server.

11:30 AM UTC:
The Nginx configuration was rolled back to the previous stable version.

12:00 PM UTC:
Service was fully restored, and all systems returned to normal operations.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause was an erroneous configuration change in the Nginx load balancer. A recent update to the Nginx configuration intended to optimize routing inadvertently contained a syntax error. This error caused Nginx to route all incoming traffic to a single application server, overwhelming it and resulting in the server being unable to handle incoming requests, leading to the 503 errors.

Resolution:
The resolution involved rolling back the Nginx configuration to the last known good configuration. The DevOps team reviewed the Nginx configuration files and found the misconfiguration. They promptly reverted the change, and after restarting the Nginx service, traffic distribution across the server pool returned to normal. This restored the availability of the web application, resolving the outage.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Review Configuration Management:
Implement stricter controls and peer review processes for configuration changes, especially in critical systems like load balancers.

Improve Monitoring and Alerts:
Enhance monitoring to detect unbalanced traffic distribution across servers. This could have provided an earlier indication of the specific problem.

Automated Configuration Testing:
Introduce automated tests for Nginx configurations to catch syntax errors and routing issues before deployment.

Tasks:

 Implement a pre-deployment checklist for all configuration changes, including peer review and automated testing.
 Update Datadog monitoring to include alerts for uneven server traffic distribution and load balancer health.
 Conduct a training session for engineers on best practices for Nginx configuration management and troubleshooting.
 Review and document the rollback procedures for critical system configurations, ensuring quick recovery in case of future incidents.
This incident highlighted the need for improved configuration management and monitoring to prevent similar issues in the future. By implementing the outlined corrective measures, we aim to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve our overall system reliability.
